# Odometry_Assignment

Exercise 2.1: write the code for a ROS node that subscribes to the 
robot wheel encoders and publishes the processed odometry
 
Exercise 2.2: Visualize the results in RVIZ

```shell 
$ roslaunch robotsterrestres_exercise2 display_notfiltered.launch
```

Exercise 2.3: compare your output with the robots filtered odometryin the topic /odometry/filtered. Are there any differences? (visualize the results in RVIZ)

```shell 
$ roslaunch robotsterrestres_exercise2 display_filteredodometry.launch
```
